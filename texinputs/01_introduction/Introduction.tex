\paragraph{Reasoning behind this effort}

\begin{itemize}
\item Simplified models only one signature at a time, sometimes not
gauge invariant
\item One step beyond this: less-simplified models

\item Compare and confront different search sensitivity

\item Combinations among different signatures

\item Find new kinematic regimes / improve searches by exploring
different signatures

\item Still keeping the choice of model generic enough that this is reusable
for theorists

\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Reasoning behind this effort}

\begin{itemize}

\item Reasoning behind the choice of model

\item Highlights more than one signature at a time, depending on
parameters

\item Leaves room for new unexplored kinematic signatures within
existing searches (left for future work)

\item Complete enough, still simplified so that one can choose grid
planes

\item Existing theory effort (HXSWG)
\end{itemize}

We investigate in detail the kinematics of three experimental signatures that are sensitive to this model: 

\begin{itemize}
\item the Higgs+\MET signature, where the \MET is produced by the decay of the pseudoscalar that couples to dark matter and the Higgs is produced either in association with this pseudoscalar or as a product of the decay of the second pseudoscalar; 

\item the Z+\MET signature, where the \MET is produced by the decay of the pseudoscalar that couples to dark matter and the Z boson is either produced in association with this pseudoscalar or radiated by the heavy Higgs boson; 

\item the $t\bar{t}$+\MET signature, where pseudoscalar that couples to dark matter is produced in association with a $t\bar{t}$ pair or radiated by one of the top quarks. 

\item 
\end{itemize}

The sensitivity of searches for this model in those signatures surpasses that of the jet+\MET searches, providing a motivation to explore their parameter space beyond the $s-$channel simplified models in~\cite{Abercrombie:2015wmb}. 

Moreover, we identify a number of other signatures that have sensitivity to this model and can be studied in the future, such as ...
