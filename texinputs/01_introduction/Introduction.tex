\paragraph{Reasoning behind this effort}

\begin{itemize}
\item Simplified models only one signature at a time, sometimes not
gauge invariant
\item One step beyond this: less-simplified models

\item Compare and confront different search sensitivity

\item Combinations among different signatures

\item Find new kinematic regimes / improve searches by exploring
different signatures

\item Still keeping the choice of model generic enough that this is reusable
for theorists

\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Reasoning behind this effort}

\begin{itemize}

\item Reasoning behind the choice of model

\item Highlights more than one signature at a time, depending on
parameters

\item Leaves room for new unexplored kinematic signatures within
existing searches (left for future work)

\item Complete enough, still simplified so that one can choose grid
planes

\item Existing theory effort (HXSWG)
\end{itemize}
