\paragraph{Technical setup}
Simulated event samples for the mono-Z signature are produced with Madgraph5\_aMC@NLO version 2.4.3, interfaced with Pythia version 8.2.2.6 for parton showering. The NNPDF3.0 PDF set is used at LO precision with the value of the strong coupling constant set to $\alpha_{S}(M_{Z}) = 0.130$ (NNPDF30\_lo\_as\_0130). Only contributions from gluon-gluon initial states and \lp\lm$\chi\overline{\chi}$ final states are considered, where l = e or $\mu$. No additional matrix element partons are considered and diagrams with an intermediate s-channel SM Higgs boson are explicitly rejected to increas the calculation efficiency (generate g g $>$ xd xd~ l+ l- / h1). 

\paragraph{Event selection}
Three consecutive stages of event selection are considered:
\begin{itemize}
\item Inclusive: Lepton \pt and $\eta$ requirements corresponding to the typical experimental trigger acceptance are applied.

\item Preselection: A dilepton candidate with an invariant mass in a window around the Z mass is required, and a minimum transverse momentum of the $\chi\overline{\chi}$ system is required.

\item Final selection: Requirements on the main variables used in the relevant analyses are added: The angular separation in the transverse plane between the $\chi\overline{\chi}$ and \lp\lm systems $\Delta\Phi(ll,\MET)$, the relative transverse momentum difference between them $|p_{T,ll} - \MET|/p_{T,ll}$ and the angular separation between the leptons $\Delta R(ll)$. Additionally, the \MET requirement is tightened.
\end{itemize}

The exact event selection criteria are listed in Tab.~\ref{tab:monozll_selection}.

\caption{Inclusive cross-sections for $pp\rightarrow \lp\lm\chi\overline{\chi}$ in the \ma-\mA scan. Maximal cross-sections are observed for the region of $\ma < \mA$ for values of $\ma\gtrsim100$ GeV.  In the $\ma\approx\mA$-region, the cross-section is suppressed by destructive interference. Finally, for a region with inverted mass hierarchy $\ma>\mA$, cross-sections of the order of multiple \ifb are observed, as long as $|\ma-\mA|$ remains sufficiently large.}

In the intermediate region around $\mA \approx \ma + \mZ$, the acceptance is strongly suppressed as the a and Z bosons are produced approximately at rest.}

\caption{\MET and  MT distributions in the signal region. The \MET distribution shows a Jacobian structure in the $\mA > \ma$ regime, the location of which strongly depends on $\mA$. In the region of inverted mass hierarchy $\mA < \ma$, the spectrum is less structured and does not fall off as steeply towards higher values. For a small mass splitting of $\ma-\mA\approx M_{Z}$, the spectrum is shifted to much lower values of \MET. The MT distribution allows to access the resonant nature of the process. Clear mass peaks are present for the normal mass hierarchy. In the inverted region, the MT distribution is more sensitive to the mass difference $\ma-\mA$ than the \MET distribution, allowing to differentiate between signal hypotheses that give near-identical \MET distributions. }
