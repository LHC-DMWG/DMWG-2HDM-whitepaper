Mono-Z analyses use events with a reconstructed Z boson recoiling symmetrically against \MET to detect the production of invisible particles.
In previous LHC analyses~\cite{Aaboud:2017bja,Sirunyan:2017qfc}, the DM interpretations of the analysis results have focused on either invisible decays of the SM-like Higgs bosons or topologies where the Z boson is produced as initial-state radiation (ISR) off a quark. The ISR-based topologies generically favor radiation of a gluon or photon rather than a massive gauge boson, thus limiting the discovery sensitive of a Z-based approach compared to monojet and mono-photon searches. In contrast, the model studies in this document generates the mono-Z signature dominantly via the all-bosonic H-a-Z vertex, which can lead to enhancements of the mono-Z sensitivity compared to jet and photon signature. In this section, the behavior and experimental accessibility of the model in Z+\MET events is studied.

\paragraph{Technical setup}
Simulated event samples for the leptonic mono-Z signature are produced with Madgraph5\_aMC@NLO version 2.4.3, interfaced with Pythia version 8.2.2.6 for parton showering. The NNPDF3.0 PDF set is used at LO precision with the value of the strong coupling constant set to $\alpha_{S}(M_{Z}) = 0.130$ (NNPDF30\_lo\_as\_0130). A five floavor scheme with a massless b-quark is used.  Only contributions from gluon-gluon initial states and \lp\lm$\chi\overline{\chi}$ final states are considered, where l = e or $\mu$. No additional matrix element partons are considered and diagrams with an intermediate s-channel SM Higgs boson are explicitly rejected to increase the calculation efficiency (generate g g $>$ xd xd~ l+ l- / h1). 


\paragraph{Event selection}
Three consecutive stages of event selection are considered:
\begin{itemize}
\item Inclusive: Lepton \pt and $\eta$ requirements corresponding to the typical experimental trigger acceptance are applied.

\item Preselection: A dilepton candidate with an invariant mass in a window around the Z mass is required, and a minimum transverse momentum of the $\chi\overline{\chi}$ system is required.

\item Final selection: Requirements on the main variables used in the relevant analyses are added: The angular separation in the transverse plane between the $\chi\overline{\chi}$ and \lp\lm systems $\Delta\Phi(ll,\MET)$, the relative transverse momentum difference between them $|p_{T,ll} - \MET|/p_{T,ll}$ and the angular separation between the leptons $\Delta R(ll)$. Additionally, the \MET requirement is tightened.
\end{itemize}

The exact event selection criteria are listed in Tab.~\ref{tab:monozll_selection}.

\paragraph{Cross-sections, kinematic distributions and acceptance}
The overall cross-sections in the \tanb and mass scans are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:monoz_ll_xs_inclusive}.
In the mass scan, maximal cross-sections are observed for the region of $\ma < \mA$ for values of $\ma\gtrsim100$ GeV. Towards higher values of both \ma and \mA, the cross-sections fall off, reaching values smaller than $1$ fb at $\ma\approx450$ GeV or $\mA\approx1.1$ TeV. In the $\ma\approx\mA$-region, the cross-section is suppressed by destructive interference. For the region with inverted mass hierarchy $\ma>\mA$, cross-sections of the order of multiple fb are observed, as long as $|\ma-\mA|$ remains sufficiently large.
In the \tanb scan, cross-sections smoothly fall with increasing $\ma$ as well as $\tanb$. Cross-sections are typically larger than 1 fb up to $\tanb\approx5$. The dependence on $\ma$ is modulated by the value of \tanb: Crossing the $\ma$ range from $100$ to $400$ GeV, cross-sections are reduced by a factor $\approx7$ for small $\tanb\approx1$, but only a factor $\approx2$ for higher values of $\tanb\approx5$.
For the \sinp scan shown in Figure \ref{fig:monoz_ll_sinp_scan_xsec}, the \sinp impact depends on whether or not the $a \rightarrow \ttbar$ decays are accesible.  
For \ma < 350 GeV they are not accesible and cross section strictly increases with \sinp.  For \ma > 350 \GeV, the $a \rightarrow \ttbar$ decays become possible causing the cross section to decrease for large values of \sinp.

%For \ma <350 GeV they are not accesible,  and only the heavy scalar's branching fraction to $aZ$ is relevant.  This branching fraction stricly increases with \sinp.  For \ma > 350 \GeV, the branching fraction of $a \rightarrow \chi \chi$ also becomes important, and there is a turnover point were the cross section decreases.





Acceptances for the mass and \tanb scans are shown in Figures \ref{fig:monoz_ll_acceptance} and \ref{fig:monoz_ll_tanbma_acceptance}.  
In the mass scan, for points where the Jacobian Peak is below the analysis's \MET cut, from $\ma = 100$ $\mA = 200$ to $\ma = 300$ $\mA = 400$, 
acceptance drops sharply approaching zero.  Above this region, acceptance curves are grouped into bands for fixed values of $\mA-\ma$.  
Acceptances increase with increasing $\mA-\ma$, gradually plateauing to a maximum value of 50\%.  In the inverted mass region, 
acceptance is generally lower than the rest of the mass scan, but for light values of \ma can reach values as large as 30\%.
In the \tanb scan, acceptance is largely independent of \tanb and constant for equal values of \ma.

To assess the kinematic behavior of the signal, the distributions of the kinematic variables that are most relevant to the Mono-Z signature are studied as a function of the model parameters.

Similar to mono-h, in the mono-Z channel a resonantly produced heavy scalar, $H$, decaying to $aZ$ produces a characteristic Jacobian peak in the \MET distribution.  The location of this peak depends on \mH, \ma, and $M_{Z}$ as given by equation \ref{eq:monoz_jacobian_peak}.  Figure \ref{fig:monoz_ll_mA_scan} shows how the position of the Jacobian peak shifts for increasing values of \mH.  For this paper, a subset of models are studied where \mA is degenerate with \mH.    

\begin{align}
E^{\mathrm{miss},max}_T \approx \frac{\sqrt{\left(\mH^2 -\ma^2 -M_{Z}^2\right)^2 - 4 \ma^2 M_{h}^2}}{2\mZ}\,.
\label{eq:monoZ_jacobian_peak}
\end{align}

The distribution of the invariant masses of the dilepton and $\chi\chi$ systems are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:monoz_kin_inclusive}. Independent of the parameters, the dilepton mass spectrum is centered at the Z peak, without any nonresonant contribution. The $M_{\chi\chi}$ distribution illustrates the signal contributions from different diagrams. For $\mA>\ma$, DM is dominantly produced from on-shell $a$ boson production. In the inverted mass region $\mA<\ma$, the situation is reversed, and $H$ diagrams dominate.

After applying the preselection requirements, the distributions of kinematic variables are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:monoz_kin_presel}. In the region of $\mA>\ma$, distinct Jacobian peaks are visible in the distributions of the mediator \pt, the width of which generally increases with values of $\ma$ and $\mA$. Significant portions of the spectrum are situated at relatively high boosts ($\MET>\unit[200]{GeV}$), which is more easily accessible experimentally.
This behavior is contrasted by the distributions in the inverted mass regions, which show nearly no distinct features and are mainly located at low mediator \
pt. For $\mA\approx\ma+m_{Z}$, both the a and Z bosons are produced approximately at rest, leading to an event population with overall low boost. These qualitative trends are consistent between the observables studied here.

Finally, the distributions of the $\MET$ and $\MT$ variables after final selection are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:monoz_kin_final}. Traditionally, the Mono-Z search has relied on the $\MET$ distribution for signal extraction. While the presence of the Jacobian peak structure in the distribution facilitates signal-background separation, it may be beneficial to also consider the $\MT$ distribution. Although only transverse information is available, the resonant structure of the signal is significantly enhanced in the $\MT$ variable, which may enhance the sensitivity of a specialized search strategy.

The \tanb and $\sin(\theta)$ variables have minimal effects on the distributions of kinematic variables (Fig.~\ref{fig:monoz_kin_tanb_sintheta}).


\paragraph{Expected significance}

Expected sensitivity for the Mono-Z(ll) channel to 2HDM+a models are approximated using generator level signal samples and published background estimates from recent $Z(\ell \ell) + \MET$ searches of 36.1 \ifb of data \cite{Aaboud:2017bja}.

Following the Asimov approximation, expected significance is calculated as the ratio of likelihoods given by equation \ref{eq:significance} and is valid even for $s$ not $\ll b$ \cite{Cowan:2010js}.  
This equation is modified to account for systematic uncertainties on the background (\ref{eq:significance_wsyst}) \cite{Cowan:2012}, and the total significance is taken as the per bin significances summed in quadrature.

For the signal events a reconstruction efficiency of 75\% is assumed.  To be consistent with the background estimates, the same selection cuts as \cite{Aaboud:2017bja} are used.  Signal and background are binned in \MET, and a conservative 20\% systematic on the background is assumed for \MET < 120 \GeV and 10\% above.

Expected significances are shown in Figure \ref{fig:expected_significance_monozll}, with regions the ATLAS and CMS detectors should be sensitive to, greater than 2, highlighted.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:significance}
Z = \sqrt{2 \bigg( (s+b) \ln{1 + \frac{s}{b}} - S \bigg) }
\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
\label{eq:significance_wsyst}
Z^\prime_{bin} = \sqrt{ 2 \cdot \bigg( (s+b) \ln[\frac{ (s+b) (b+\sigma_b^2) } {b^2 + (s+b) \sigma_b^2} ]- \frac{b^2}{\sigma_b^2} \ln[1 + \frac{\sigma_b^2 s}{b(b+\sigma_b^2)} ] \bigg) }
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{S} = \sqrt{\sum_{bin} (Z^\prime_{bin})^2}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Conclusions} The Mono-Z(ll) provides experimental coverage of the pseudoscalar 2HDM model for a broad part of the parameter space. The light pseudoscalar \a can be probed up to mass values of $\approx\unit[350]{GeV}$, depending on the choice of other parameters. The Mono-Z is sensitive mostly in the region of low values of $\tanb<4$.
