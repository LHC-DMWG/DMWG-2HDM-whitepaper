\paragraph{Technical setup}
Simulated event samples for the mono-Z signature are produced with Madgraph5\_aMC@NLO version 2.4.3, interfaced with Pythia version 8.2.2.6 for parton showering. The NNPDF3.0 PDF set is used at LO precision with the value of the strong coupling constant set to $\alpha_{S}(M_{Z}) = 0.130$ (NNPDF30\_lo\_as\_0130). Only contributions from gluon-gluon initial states and \lp\lm$\chi\overline{\chi}$ final states are considered, where l = e or $\mu$. No additional matrix element partons are considered and diagrams with an intermediate s-channel SM Higgs boson are explicitly rejected to increas the calculation efficiency (generate g g $>$ xd xd~ l+ l- / h1). 


\paragraph{Event selection}
Three consecutive stages of event selection are considered:
\begin{itemize}
\item Inclusive: Lepton \pt and $\eta$ requirements corresponding to the typical experimental trigger acceptance are applied.

\item Preselection: A dilepton candidate with an invariant mass in a window around the Z mass is required, and a minimum transverse momentum of the $\chi\overline{\chi}$ system is required.

\item Final selection: Requirements on the main variables used in the relevant analyses are added: The angular separation in the transverse plane between the $\chi\overline{\chi}$ and \lp\lm systems $\Delta\Phi(ll,\MET)$, the relative transverse momentum difference between them $|p_{T,ll} - \MET|/p_{T,ll}$ and the angular separation between the leptons $\Delta R(ll)$. Additionally, the \MET requirement is tightened.
\end{itemize}

The exact event selection criteria are listed in Tab.~\ref{tab:monozll_selection}.

\paragraph{Results}
The overall cross-sections in the \tanb and mass scans are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:xs_inclusive}.
In the mass scan, maximal cross-sections are observed for the region of $\ma < \mA$ for values of $\ma\gtrsim100$ GeV. Towards higher values of both \ma and \mA, the cross-sections fall off, reaching values smaller than $1$ fb at $\ma\approx450$ GeV or $\mA\approx1.1$ TeV. In the $\ma\approx\mA$-region, the cross-section is suppressed by destructive interference. For the region with inverted mass hierarchy $\ma>\mA$, cross-sections of the order of multiple fb are observed, as long as $|\ma-\mA|$ remains sufficiently large.
In the \tanb scan, cross-sections smoothly fall with increasing $\ma$ as well as $\tanb$. Cross-sections are typically larger than 1 fb up to $\tanb\approx5$. The dependence on $\ma$ is modulated by the value of \tanb: Crossing the $\ma$ range from $100$ to $400$ GeV, cross-sections are reduced by a factor $\approx7$ for small $\tanb\approx1$, but only a factor $\approx2$ for higher values of $\tanb\approx5$.

Acceptances for the mass and \tanb scans are shown in Figures \ref{fig:monoz_ll_acceptance} and \ref{fig:monoz_ll_tanbma_acceptance}.  
In the mass scan, from \ma=100, \mA=250 to \ma=350, \mA=450 we can see that for mass points where the Jacobian Peak is below the \MET cut of the ananalysis, acceptances drop sharply approaching 0.  Above this region, acceptances are grouped into bands for fixed values of \mA - \ma.  For heavy \mA values, acceptance change more gradually and reach a maximum value of 50\%.  In the inverted mass region, acceptances are generally lower than the rest of the mass scan, but for light values of \mA, can reach acceptances as high as 30\%.  In the \tanb scan, acceptance is largely independent of \tanb and is constant for equal values of \ma.  

To assess the kinematic behavior of the signal, the distributions of the kinematic variables that are most relevant to the Mono-Z signature are studied as a function of the model parameters.

The distribution of the invariant masses of the dilepton and $\chi\chi$ systems are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:monoz_kin_inclusive}. Independent of the of parameters, the dilepton mass spectrum is centered at the Z peak, without any nonresonant contribution. The $M_{\chi\chi}$ distribution illustrates the signal contributions from different diagrams. For $\mA>\ma$, DM is dominantly produced from on-shell $a$ boson production. In the inverted mass region $\mA<\ma$, the situation is reversed, and $A$ diagrams dominate.

After applying the preselection requirements, the distributions of kinematic variables are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:monoz_kin_presel}. In the region of $\mA>\ma$, distinct Jacobian peaks are visible in the distributions of the mediator \pt, the width of which generally increases with the $\ma$ and $\mA$. Significant portions of the spectrum are situated at relatively high boosts ($\MET>200 GeV$), which is more easily accessible experimentally.
This behavior is constrasted by the distributions in the inverted mass regions, which show nearly no distinct features and are mainly located at low mediator \pt. For $\mA~\ma+m_{Z}$, both the a and Z bosons are produced close to at rest, leading to an event population with overall low boost. These qualitative trends are consistend between the observables studied here.
Finally, the distributions of the $\MET$ and $\MT$ variables after final selection are shown in Fig.~\ref{monoz_kin_final}. Traditionally, the Mono-Z search has relied on the $\MET$ distribution for signal extraction. While the presence of the Jacobian peak structure in the distribution facilitates signal-background separation, it may be beneficial to also consider the $\MT$ distribution. Although only transverse information is available, the resonant structure of the signal is significantly enhanced in the $\MT$ variable, which may enhance the sensitivity of a specialized search strategy.

The \tanb and $\sin(\theta)$ variables have minimal effect on the distributions of kinematic variables (Fig.~\ref{fig:monoz_kin_tanb_sintheta}).

of $a\rightarrow\chi\chi$.  Above 350 GeV for large values of \sinp, there is a turnover point where the reduced $a\rightarrow\chi\chi$ branching fraction outweights the increased $H \rightarrow aZ$ branching and the net cross section decreases.}

For a small mass splitting of $\ma-\mA\approx M_{Z}$, the spectrum is shifted to much lower values of \MET. The MT distribution allows to access the resonant nature of the process. Clear mass peaks are present for the normal mass hierarchy. In the inverted region, the MT distribution is more sensitive to the mass difference $\ma-\mA$ than the \MET distribution, allowing to differentiate between signal hypotheses that give near-identical \MET distributions. }

Expected significances for 2HDMa models are calculated using generator level signal samples and background estimates from recent $Z(\ell \ell) + \MET$ searches analyzing 36.1 \ifb of data \cite{Aaboud:2017bja}.

Following the Asimov approximation, the expected significance for the ratio of likelihoods is given by equation \ref{eq:significance} and is valid even for $s$ not $\ll b$ \cite{Cowan:2010js}.  
This equation is modified to account for systematic uncertainties on the background (\ref{eq:significance_wsyst}) \cite{Cowan:2012}, and the total significance is taken as the per bin significances summed in quadrature.

For the signal events a reconstruction efficiency of 75\% is assumed.  To be consistent with the background estimates, the ATLAS selection cuts are used.  The significances are calulated for bins of \MET.  A conservative 20\% systematic is assumed for \MET < and 10\% for MET >.

The expected significnaces are shown  in Figure \ref{fig:expected_significance_monozll}, the LHC should be sensitive to models with a significance greater than 2. 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:significance}
Z = \sqrt{2 \bigg( (s+b) \ln{1 + \frac{s}{b}} - S \bigg) }
\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
\label{eq:significance_wsyst}
Z^\prime_{bin} = \sqrt{ 2 \cdot \bigg( (s+b) \ln[\frac{ (s+b) (b+\sigma_b^2) } {b^2 + (s+b) \sigma_b^2} ]- \frac{b^2}{\sigma_b^2} \ln[1 + \frac{\sigma_b^2 s}{b(b+\sigma_b^2)} ] \bigg) }
\end{equation}
