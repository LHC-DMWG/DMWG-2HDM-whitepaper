Heavy flavour final state have sizeable contributions to the production of the CP-even and CP-odd scalar mass eigenstates, due to the Yukawa structure 
of the couplings in the matter sector. 
In the following sections,  the most important signatures involving either visible or invisible decays of the heavy Higgses are reviewed.

\subsection{Recasting existing tt+\met and bb+\met signatures}
\label{sub:hfttrecast}
These two signatures are dominantly produced in diagrams involving the invisible decays of the two CP-odd scalars. 
Their relevance is therefore determined by the two pseudoscalar masses, $m(A)$ and $m(a)$ and it is a function of 
$sin\theta$ and $tan\beta$. 
For both $bb$ and $tt$ associated productions, we find that the
highest sensitivity of this signatures is obtained for high values of $sin\theta$.

The 2HDM+a model is equivalent to a single pseudoscalar simplified
model (DMF) when $A$ is much heavier than $a$, and therefore the
former does not contribute to the considered final state. However,
when the two mediators are closer in mass, the $pp\rightarrow ttA$
contribution becomes more relevant  as it is possible to observe in 
Figure~\ref{fig:mdd}, where the two models are compared
assuming $m(A) = 750$ GeV and two different values
for $m(a)$. An excellent agreement was observed between
$DMSIMP$ and $2HDMp$ on parton-level variables sensitive 
to the helicity structure of the interaction between top and the
mediator\cite{Haisch:2016gry}, if the invariant mass of the two DM
particles in the 2HDM is required to be smalle than 200(300)~GeV for
$m(a)=150(300)$~GeV respectively, giving confidence that,
once the contribution from $A$ production is separated, it is possible
to fully map the $2HDM+a$ kinematics into the DMF simplified model.

respectively.}
\label{fig:mdd}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

This remapping is achieved by
taking for each set of the parameters the 
average of the selection acceptances for $m(A)$ and $M(A)$ as 
calculated with $DMSIMP$ weighted by the respective 
cross-section for $A$ ($\sigma_A$) and $a$ 
($\sigma_a$) production, in formulas
\begin{equation}
Acc_{2HDM}(m(A),M(a))=\frac{\sigma_a \times Acc_{DMSIMP}(m(a))+
\sigma_A \times Acc_{DMSIMP}(m(A))}{\sigma_a+\sigma_A}
\label{rew}
\end{equation}
The acceptance in this case is a parton level implementation of the
two-lepton analysis described in [arXiv:1710.11412].
The acceptance estimated in this way is shown as red triangles 
in Figure~\ref{fig:tbfin}, and an excellent agreement 
can be seen with the acceptances evaluated directly on the 2HDM 
samples.

and for the $DMSIMP$ model (full line) for a mediator
mass of 150~GeV. The two dashed lines indicate
the statistical error of the $DMSIMP$. The value of $m(A)$ is fixed at 
600~GeV, and $\sin\theta=0.35$.

The acceptance estimated in this way is shown as red triangles

can be seen with the acceptances evaluated directly on the 2HDM 
samples. Further validation were performed also on the acceptances calculated for zero and one lepton final states [1710.11412,1711.11520], 
both as a function of $sin\theta$ and $tan\beta$ and can be observed in Fig~\ref{DMHF:pof}.
Finally, the formula was succesfully tested also the situation in
which $|m(A)-m(a)| \sim 50$ GeV, 
implying the possibility of a large interference
between the production of the two bosons.

\subsubsection{Motivations for an high $tan\beta$ scan for bb+\met}

The projection of sensitivity in $tan\beta$ for benchmark \#2,  based on the CMS results for bb+MET [arXiv:1706.02581]
are shown in Figure~\ref{DMHF:bbscan}. The reach for an upper bound on tan(beta) with bb+MET shows 
good potential, for $tan\beta$ values above 10. 

\textbf{Say something about high width for H?}

\subsection{Motivation for a dedicated tW+\met search}

The sensitivity of the LHC experiments to the associated 
production of dark matter with a single top has been recently studied \cite{Pani:2017qyd} in the framework
of an extension of the standard model featuring two Higgs doublets and
an additional pseudoscalar mediator. 
This study extends the work of previous literature \cite{Pinna:2017tay}, which demostrated using
a simplified model that the consideration of final states involving a single top quark and DM (DM$t$)
increases the coverage of existing analyses targeting the DM$t\bar t$ process.

%($pp \rightarrow tj\chi\chi$)}
\label{fig:feyn1}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


Like single top production within the SM, the DM$t$ signature in the model
 receives  three different types of contributions at leading order (LO) in QCD. These are $t$-channel production, $s$-channel production and
associated production together with a $W$ boson ($tW$) (Fig.~\ref{fig:feyn1}).
When the decay $H^{\pm}\rightarrow W^{\pm} a$ is possible, the $H^{\pm}$ is produced on-shell, 
and the cross-section of $pp \rightarrow tW\chi\chi$, 
assuming  $H^{\pm}$ masses of a few hundred \GeV, is around one order of magnitude larger 
than the one for the same process in the simplified model. Moreover the production 
and cascade decay of a resonance yields kinematic signatures
which can be exploited to separate the signal from the SM background. 


Dedicated selections considering one and two lepton final states are
developed to assess the coverage in parameter space for this signature 
at a centre-of-mass energy of  $14\,\TeV$ assuming an integrated
luminosity of 300~fb$^{-1}$ in Ref.~\cite{Pani:2017qyd}. 
Background and signal Monte Carlo simulated
samples are employed for the estimate of the results. The effect of the detector on the kinematic quantities
utilised in the analysis is simulated by applying a Gaussian smearing to the momenta
of  the different reconstructed objects and reconstruction and tagging efficiency factors.
Figure~\ref{DMHF:monotopres} shows the sensitivy reach for two of the
parameter scans proposed in this whitepaper. 
On the top panel the exclusion reach for the $m(a),tan\beta$ plane is
presented, assuming $sin\theta = 0.35$ and $m(A) = m(H^\pm) = m(H) =
500$ GeV. 
%The results are derived from the simulated samples using a
%re-scaling  procedure described in Ref.[IN PREPARATION]
It is possible to observe that for this scenario the sensitivity reach
is comparable to the one from the mono-h signature as presented in
Ref.~\cite{Bauer:2017ota}. On the bottom panel of
Figure~\ref{DMHF:monotopres} the signature's sensitivity to benchmark \#4
 is evaluated for the first time.

\subsection{Uncovered signatures with $tt h+\met$}

As discussed in Section~\ref{sub:hfttrecast}, the production of the
heavy mediator $A$ gives a sizeable contribution to the $tt+\met$  
production cross section in the $2HDM+a$ model. This is also true for
the heavy $H$. When the decay of these mediators into the lightest
pseudoscalar $a$ is allowed, this decay process dominates over the
direct decay into $\chi\chi$. In symmetry with what happens for the
mono-h signature discussed in \cite{Bauer:2017ota}, for certain region
of parameter space the signatures $pp \rightarrow t\bar t A
\rightarrow t \bar t a h$ and $pp \rightarrow t\bar t H
\rightarrow t \bar t a Z$ become sizeable. For the former case, it can
be estimated from Fig. 12(b) of Ref.~\cite{Bauer:2017ota} that for
relatively small $m(A)$ the $pp \rightarrow t\bar t ah$ cross section
can be up to 30\% that of the $pp\rightarrow t \bar t \chi\chi$
process. The interplay between the parameters of the model, and
especially between the heavy higgs masses for these types of final
state render the phenomenology interesting and variegated, as can be
seen for example in the branching ratio study of Fig.~\ref{fig:brAHah}, although
further studies are needed to fully understand the interplay and the
complementarity between these $tth+\met$ channels and the traditional
heavy flavour dark matter searches.

\subsection{Top pair resonant searches}

Heavy scalar and pseudoscalar bosons decaying dominantly into top-quark pairs can be
searched for by studying the resulting \ttbar\ invariant mass
spectra. However, interference effects between the signal processes
and the SM \ttbar\ production distort the signal shape from a single
peak to a peak-dip structure [appropriate REFs?]. Interference between
a loop-induced and a tree-level process cannot currently be simulated in MadGraph.
To amend this problem, the "Higgs\_Effective\_Couplings\_FormFactor"
approach \cite{ttinterfHFF} is implemented in the UFO, replacing the loop production by an
effective vertex.
\textbf{Are we interested to insert one of the validation plots from atlas?}
