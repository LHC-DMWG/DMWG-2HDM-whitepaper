\section{$\bm{E_T^{\rm miss}}$ signatures and their kinematic distributions}
\label{sec:experimentbasics}

The mono-$X$ phenomenology in the  \hdma model is determined by the values of the parameters introduced in ~\eqref{eq:inputparameters}. These model parameters can affect the total signal cross sections of the $\MET$ signatures, their kinematic distributions, or both. In this section we will discuss the basic features of the most important mono-$X$ channels and identify the experimental observables that can be exploited to search for them. Our discussion will  mainly focus on the benchmark~\eqref{eq:benchmark} but we will also present results for other parameter choices to illustrate how a given parameter affects a certain $\MET$ signature.  All results in this section are obtained at the particle level and employ no or only minimal selection requirements.

\end{figure}

Broadly speaking, in the  \hdma model there are two different kinds of $\MET$ signatures. Signals of the first type can be resonantly produced \color{red}[Caterina: "signals can be resonantly produced" may not be the clearest sentence for an experimental newcomer, but I'm not sure of how to clarify this.]\color{black} and  channels such as $h+\MET$, $Z+ \MET$ and $tW+\MET$ belong to this class. Relevant examples of Feynman graphs are shown in~Figure~\ref{fig:resonant}. In the case of the mono-Higgs signature, it is evident from the figure that for $M_A > M_h + M_a$ the triangle  graph depicted on the left in the upper row  allows for resonant mono-Higgs production.  Similar resonance enhancements arise from the diagram on the left-hand side for the mono-$Z$ (middle row) and $tW+\MET$ (lower row) channel if $M_H > M_Z + M_a$ and $M_H^\pm > M_W + M_a$, respectively. Notice that resonant $h+\MET$, $Z+\MET$ and $tW+\MET$ production is not possible in the spin-0  DM models proposed by the DM forum (DMF)~\cite{Abercrombie:2015wmb} because in these models the mediators couple only to fermions at tree level. As a result only diagrams of the type shown on the right-hand side of the latter figure are present in  these models.

\caption{\label{fig:hMET} Normalised $\MET$ distributions of mono-Higgs production in the \hdma model for different values of $\mA$ and $\ma$ as indicated in the legends. The shown results correspond to the benchmark parameter choices introduced in~\eqref{eq:benchmark}. \color{red}[Caterina: are those at parton level?]\color{black}
}  
\end{figure}

Processes that are resonantly enhanced in the \hdma model have in common that they involve the on-shell decay of a heavy Higgs $H,A,H^\pm$ to a SM particle and the mediator~$a$, which   itself  subsequently decays to a pair of DM particles. The kinematics of the process $A \to B C$ is governed by the two-body phase space for three massive particles 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:twophasespace}
\lambda(m_A, m_B, m_C) = (m_A^2 -m_B^2-m_C^2)^2 -  4 \hspace{0.25mm} m_B^2 \hspace{0.25mm}  m_C^2 \,,
\end{equation}
and this quantity determines the characteristic shape of resonant $\MET$ signals in the context of the \hdma model. For instance, in the case of the mono-Higgs signal the $\MET$ spectrum  will have a Jacobian peak with an endpoint at~\cite{No:2015xqa,Bauer:2017ota}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:monoHMETpeak}
E^{\rm{miss}}_{T, {\rm max} } \simeq \frac{\lambda^{1/2}(M_A, M_h, M_a)}{2 M_A^2}\,, 
\end{equation}
for all mass configurations that satisfy $M_A > M_h + M_a$. 

In Figure~\ref{fig:hMET} we show the predictions for the normalised $\MET$ distribution of $h+\MET$ production in the \hdma model for different Higgs masses $\mA$ and $\ma$. Besides the indicated values of $\mA$ and $\ma$ the parameters  used  are those given in~\eqref{eq:benchmark}. As can be seen from the figure,  increasing~$\mA$ ($\ma$) shifts the endpoint of the Jacobian peak to higher~(lower) $\MET$  values as expected from~\eqref{eq:monoHMETpeak}. A~second feature that is also visible is  the plot is that for large mass splittings~$\mA - \ma$, the $\MET$ spectra develop a pronounced low-$\MET$ tail. The events in these tails arise dominantly from the box diagram shown on the right in the upper row of~Figure~\ref{fig:resonant}. One can also see that these non-resonant contributions interfere with the resonant contributions that stem from triangle graphs. Due to the interplay of resonant and non-resonant contributions  the exact shape of the $\MET$ distribution is   away from the endpoint~\eqref{eq:monoHMETpeak} a non-trivial function of the \hdma parameters~\eqref{eq:inputparameters}.  

At the LHC a mono-Higgs signal has so far been searched for in the $h \to \gamma \gamma$ and the~$h \to b \bar b$ channel (see~\cite{Aaboud:2017uak,Aaboud:2017yqz,CMS-PAS-B2G-17-004}  for the latest ATLAS and CMS results).  While both searches use $\MET$ as the main selection variable to discriminate signal from background, the $\MET$ values for which the $\gamma \gamma + \MET$ search is most sensitive are smaller than those that give the highest sensitivity in the case of $b \bar b + \MET$. This feature makes the two modes complementary in the sense that a models with  small  splittings $\mA - \ma$ are best probed in the former channel, while realisations with a larger mass hierarchy can be well tested via the latter final state. The decay channel~$h \to WW$ also offers interesting prospects to search for a mono-Higgs signal in the \hdma model~\cite{GPHeidelberg} but as yet has not been studied by the LHC collaborations.  Auxiliary figures showing mono-Higgs distributions in the \hdma model can be found in Appendix~\ref{app:extramonoh}. 

\subsection*{Mono-$\bm{Z}$ signature}

\begin{figure}[t!]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=0.45\textwidth]{texinputs/04_grid/newfigures/ptzspec.pdf}	\qquad 
\includegraphics[height=0.45\textwidth]{texinputs/04_grid/newfigures/mtspec.pdf}
\vspace{2mm}
\caption{\label{fig:zptmt} Normalised $p_{T,Z}$ (left panel) and $M_T (\ell^+ \ell^-, \MET)$ (right panel) distributions for $Z + \MET$ production followed by $Z \to \ell^+ \ell^-$. The shown predictions have been obtained for the \hdma benchmark parameter choices  given in~\eqref{eq:benchmark} and employ different values of~$M_H$ and~$M_a$ as indicated in the legends.}
\end{figure}

Like for the mono-Higgs signal also in the mono-$Z$ case shape analyses of the~$\MET$ variable offer a powerful way to enhance the signal-to-backround ratio. The endpoint of the $\MET$ spectrum for the $Z+\MET$ signature can be simply obtained from~\eqref{eq:monoHMETpeak} by the replacements $M_A \to M_H$ and $M_h \to M_Z$. Plots that show the corresponding $\MET$ distributions can be found in Appendix~\ref{app:extramonoz}. Since the four-momenta of the decay products $Z$ and $a$ that enter $H \to Za$ are fixed by $H$ being preferentially on-shell, also the spectrum of the $Z$-boson transverse momentum ($p_{T,Z}$) in mono-$Z$ production will have a characteristic shape if $M_H > M_Z + M_a$. In fact,  the $p_{T,Z}$ distribution is like the $\MET$ spectrum predicted  to be Jacobian with a cut-off at~\cite{No:2015xqa,Bauer:2017ota}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:monoZpTpeak}
p_{T,Z}^{ {\rm max} } \simeq \frac{\lambda^{1/2}(M_H, M_Z, M_a)}{2 M_H^2}\,,
\end{equation}
that is smeared by the total decay width $\Gamma_H$ of the heavy Higgs $H$. Notice that  ignoring parton-shower and detector effects the shapes of the $p_{T,Z}$ and $\MET$ spectra are identical. Whether a shape fit to $\MET$ or $p_{T,Z}$ provides a better experimental reach thus depends to first approximation only on which of the two variables can be better measured.

Another useful observable to study the properties of processes involving visible and invisible decay production is the transverse mass 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:transversemass}
M_T (A,B) = \sqrt{m_A^2+m_B^2 + 2 \left (E_{T,A} E_{T,B} - \vec{p}_{T,A} \cdot \vec{p}_{T,B} \right )} \,,
\end{equation}
where $E_{T,A}$ ($E_{T,B}$) denotes the transverse energy of the final-state configuration $A$ ($B$) and~$\vec{p}_{T,A}$  ($\vec{p}_{T,B}$) is the corresponding transverse momentum three-vector. In the case of the mono-$Z$ search that looks for the leptonic decay of the $Z$ boson, the transverse mass can be constructed from the $\ell^+ \ell^-$ system and the amount of $\MET$.  

Figure~\ref{fig:zptmt} displays  $p_{T,Z}$ and $M_T(\ell^+ \ell^-, \MET)$ distributions for different choices of the masses~$M_H$ and~$M_a$. The parameters not explicitly specified in the plots have been  fixed to the values reported in~\eqref{eq:benchmark}. One observes that the differential distributions in $p_{T,Z}$ and $M_T(\ell^+ \ell^-, \MET)$ have Jacobian peaks, a feature that  reflects the resonant production of a~$H$ with the subsequent decay $H \to Z a \to \ell^+ \ell^- \chi \bar \chi$.  Increasing~$\mH$ ($\ma$) again shifts the endpoints of the distributions to higher~(lower) values of $p_{T,Z}$ and $M_T(\ell^+ \ell^-, \MET)$. Like in the mono-Higgs case, for large mass differences $M_H - M_a$, box diagrams lead to a non-negligible mono-$Z$ rate at low values of $p_{T,Z}$ and $M_T(\ell^+ \ell^-, \MET)$. Compared to the $h + \MET$ signature the interference effects between resonant and non-resonant contributions  are however  less pronounced  in  the $Z + \MET$  case. Plots showing additional  mono-$Z$ distributions are provided in~Appendix~\ref{app:extramonoz}. 

The existing LHC searches for a mono-$Z$ signal (cf.~\cite{Aaboud:2017bja,Sirunyan:2017qfc} for the most recent results) have  focused either on invisible decays of the SM-like Higgs boson or on topologies where the $Z$~boson is produced in the form of initial-state radiation (ISR). Since ISR of a $Z$~boson is compared to the radiation of a gluon suppressed by both the coupling of the~$Z$ and its mass, the mono-$Z$ signal is generically not a discovery channel in models that lead to ISR-like mono-$X$ signatures. In contrast, in the \hdma model the $Z+\MET$ sensitivity  turns out to be typically better than the one of the mono-jet channel. 

The above discussion has focused on the leptonic decay of the~$Z$~boson but searching for a mono-$Z$ signal in the hadronic channel is also possible. In fact, the hadronic and leptonic signatures  are complementary, since hadronic decays of the~$Z$~boson are more frequent than leptonic decays, but suffer from larger backgrounds. An improved background suppression is possible if ``boosted'' event topologies are studied, making the hadronic mono-$Z$ signature an interesting channel if the \hdma model includes high-mass Higgs states. Further details on $q \bar q + \MET$ search strategies can be found in~Appendix~\ref{app:extramonoz}. \color{red}[Caterina: add CONF note from ATLAS https://cds.cern.ch/record/2311941/ and monojet from CMS]\color{black}

\subsection*{Single-top signatures}

\begin{figure}[t!]
\centering

\caption{\label{fig:mt2spectra} Normalised $m_{T2}$ distributions for $tW+\MET$ production in the double-lepton channel.  The shown results correspond to the \hdma benchmark~\eqref{eq:benchmark} and employ different values of~$\mHc$ and~$\ma$ as indicated in the legends.}
\end{figure}

Single-top production in association with $\MET$ has also been shown to be a promising mono-$X$ channel in the case of spin-0 models~\cite{Pinna:2017tay,Pani:2017qyd,Plehn:2017bys}. One can study single-top production in the $s$-channel, $t$-channel  or  in association with a $W$ boson. In the following, we will focus on the $tW + \MET$ channel, which in the context of the \hdma model has been identified as the most interesting mode~\cite{Pani:2017qyd}. Example diagrams leading to a $tW + \MET$ signature are shown in the lower row of~Figure~\ref{fig:resonant}. The $tW + \MET$ signal can be searched for in the single-lepton and double-lepton final state. Analysis strategies for both channels have been developed in~\cite{Pani:2017qyd}. In the former case $M_T (\ell, \MET)$ and the asymmetric transverse mass $am_{T2}$~\cite{Konar:2009qr,Lester:2014yga} can be used to discriminate between signal and background, while in the latter case the stransverse mass $m_{T2}$~\cite{Lester:1999tx,Barr:2003rg} plays a crucial role in the background suppression. \color{red}[Caterina: worth defining MT2?]\color{black}


Examples of normalised $m_{T2}$ distributions obtained in the \hdma model are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:mt2spectra}. The coloured histograms correspond to different masses $\mHc$ and $\ma$. The parameters not indicated in the legends have been set to the values given in~\eqref{eq:benchmark}. One sees from the plots that the shape of the $m_{T2}$ spectrum is sensitive to the values that are chosen for $\mHc$ and $\ma$. In particular, the maximum of the $m_{T2}$ distribution is shifted to higher values for larger (smaller) values of $\mHc$ ($\ma$). Notice that for heavy charged Higgses the $m_{T2}$ spectrum develops a pronounced high-$m_{T2}$ tail.  This feature can be traced back to the resonant contribution $b g \to t H^+  \to  t W^+ a  \to t W^+ \chi \bar \chi$ (see~lower left graph in~Figure~\ref{fig:resonant}). At present, dedicated ATLAS and CMS analyses of the $tW + \MET$  or other single-top-like signatures with $\MET$ do not exist. Performing such studies would however be worthwhile since enhanced single-top signatures are expected to appear in many DM model that features an extended Higgs sector. 

\subsection[Non-resonant $E_T^{\rm miss}$ signatures]{Non-resonant $\bm{E_T^{\rm miss}}$ signatures}
\label{sec:nonresonant}

\begin{figure}[t!]

\caption{\label{fig:nonresonant} Prototype diagrams that lead  to a $t \bar t+\MET$~(upper row) and $j+\MET$~(lower row) signal in the \hdma model. Graphs involving a heavier pseudoscalar $A$ also contribute to the signals but are not shown explicitly.}
\end{figure}

Besides the resonant $\MET$ signatures discussed in the last subsection the   \hdma model also gives rise to non-resonant mono-$X$ signatures. The most important channels in this class are $t \bar t +\MET$ and $j+\MET$ production, but also  the $b \bar b +\MET$ mode is interesting  because its rate is $\tan \beta$ enhanced if a Yukawa sector of  type-II is realised.  Representative Feynman graphs leading to the first two signatures are depicted in~Figure~\ref{fig:nonresonant}. Notice that for $M_A \gg M_a > 2 m_\chi$ the dominant contribution to the  $t \bar t +\MET$ and mono-jet signals arise from graphs involving the  mediator $a$. In this limit the normalised kinematic distributions of the $t \bar t + \MET$ and $j+\MET$ signals in the \hdma model therefore resemble the shapes of the spectra obtained in the DMF pseudoscalar   model. Since the contributions  associated to $a$ and $A$ exchange interfere with each other, shape differences can however occur if the pseudoscalars are not widely separated in mass~\cite{Bauer:2017ota}.

\subsection*{Heavy-quark signatures}

\begin{figure}[t!]
\centering

\caption{\label{fig:ttmet} Normalised $\MET$ distributions for $t \bar t + \MET$ production. The black curves correspond to the prediction of the DMF pseudoscalar   model, while the coloured predictions illustrate the results in the \hdma benchmark model~\eqref{eq:benchmark} for two different choices of $\mA$ and $\ma$.} 
\end{figure}

Two of the main channels that have been used up to now  to search for spin-0 states with large invisible decay widths at the LHC are $t \bar t + \MET$ and $b \bar b + \MET$. The latest ATLAS and CMS analyses of this type can be found in~\cite{Aaboud:2017rzf,CMS-PAS-EXO-16-049}. These searches have been interpreted in the context of the DMF spin-0   models, and for $M_A \gg M_a$ the obtained cross-section limits can be used  to derive exclusion bounds in the \hdma model by using~\cite{Bauer:2017ota}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:rescaling}
\frac{\sigma \! \left ( pp \to t \bar t + \MET\right )_{\hdma}}{\sigma \! \left ( pp \to t \bar t + \MET\right )_{\rm DMF}} \simeq \left ( \frac{y_\chi \sin \theta}{g_\chi g_q \tan \beta} \right )^2 \, .
\end{equation}
Here $g_\chi$ ($g_q$) denotes the DM-mediator (universal quark-mediator) coupling in the DMF  pseudoscalar  model, and an analog formula holds in the case of the $b \bar b + \MET$ signature with $\tan \beta$ replaced by $\cot \beta$ in the type-II \hdma model. 

{\color{red} In Figure~\ref{fig:ttmet} we compare two normalised $\MET$ spectra obtained in the \hdma model (coloured histograms) to the prediction of the DMF pseudoscalar   model (black histograms).  The left panel illustrates the case~$M_A \gg M_a$, and one observes that the shape of the \hdma distribution resembles  the one of the DMF model within statistical uncertainties. As shown in the plot on the right-hand side, shape distortions instead arise if~the particle masses $M_A$ and $M_a$ are not widely separated.  Similar findings apply to other variables such as $m_{T2}$ which  plays a crucial role in suppressing the $t \bar t$~background in two-lepton analyses of the $t \bar t + \MET$ signature~\cite{Aaboud:2017rzf,Haisch:2016gry}. It follows that in order to accurately reproduce the kinematic distributions of the signal in the entire \hdma~parameter space, one should not rely on \eqref{eq:rescaling} but should use a more sophisticated method. A general approach  that allows to faithfully translate existing limits on DMF spin-0   models into the \hdma~parameter space  is described in~Appendix~\ref{app:recast}. There it is also shown that this rescaling procedure reproduces the results of a direct MC simulation. 
}

\subsection*{Mono-jet signature}

At the LHC the most studied mono-$X$ signal is the $j +\MET$ channel $\big($the newest analyses have been presented in \cite{Aaboud:2017phn,Sirunyan:2017jix}$\big)$ because this mode typically provides the strongest~$\MET$ constraints on models with ISR-type  signatures. Since only loop diagrams where a mediator couples to a quark (see~the graphs in lower row in Figure~\ref{fig:nonresonant}) contribute to the mono-jet signature in both the \hdma and the DMF spin-0 models, the normalised kinematic distributions of the $j +\MET$ signal is very similar in these models. In the case that the 2HDM pseudoscalar $A$ is decoupled one can use a relation similar to the one shown in~\eqref{eq:rescaling} to translate the existing mono-jet results on the DMF pseudoscalar model into the~\hdma parameter space, while in general one can apply the recasting procedure detailed in~Appendix~\ref{app:recast}.

\subsection{Parameter variations}

The  kinematic distributions shown in Sections~\ref{sec:resonant} and \ref{sec:nonresonant}  all employ the parameters~\eqref{eq:benchmark} and consider only variations of the common heavy Higgs mass $\mH = \mA = \mHc$ and the mediator mass $\ma$.  In this subsection we study the impact that modifications of the parameters away from the proposed \hdma benchmark scenarios have. The  discussion will thereby focus on the mono-Higgs and mono-$Z$ signatures since the rates and kinematic distributions of these two channels turn out to be  most sensitive to parameter changes. 

\subsection*{Variations of $\bm{\mH}$ and $\bm{\mA}$}

\begin{figure}[t!]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=0.45\textwidth]{texinputs/04_grid/newfigures/mvarl.pdf} \qquad

\vspace{2mm}
\caption{\label{fig:mvar} $\MET$ ($p_{T,Z}$) distributions for mono-Higgs~(mono-$Z$) production at $13 \, {\rm TeV}$ in the \hdma model.  The shown predictions  correspond to different sets $M_{H,A}$ of masses and employ $\mHc = {\rm min} \left ( \mH, \mA \right )$, $M_a = 300 \, {\rm GeV}$  as well as the parameters~\eqref{eq:benchmark}.}
\end{figure}

In Figure~\ref{fig:mvar} we display $\MET$ distributions in $h + \MET$ production~(left panel) and $p_{T,Z}$ distributions in $Z+\MET$ production~(right panel) for different~$\mH$ and~$\mA$ values. As~indicated, the coloured histograms correspond to  different choices of $M_{H,A}$ and $\mHc = {\rm min} \left ( \mH, \mA \right )$, but all employ $M_a = 300 \, {\rm GeV}$. From the figure it is evident that the inclusive mono-Higgs~(mono-$Z$) cross section is reduced compared to the benchmark prediction if~$\mH$~($\mA$) is taken to be smaller than $\mA$~($\mH$). 
%Numerically, we find  mono-Higgs and mono-$Z$ cross sections of $91 \, {\rm fb}$ ($16 \, {\rm fb}$) and $2.1 \, {\rm fb}$ ($1.3 \, {\rm fb}$) at $\sqrt{s} = 13 \, {\rm TeV}$, respectively. 
We furthermore observe that  a change of $\mH$ strongly affects the shape of the $\MET$ distribution, while the distortions in the $p_{T,Z}$ distribution under variations of~$\mA$ are much less pronounced. The strong $M_H$-dependence of the~$\MET$ spectrum in $h + \MET$ production can be traced back to the structure of the coupling~$g_{Aha}$. From~(\ref{eq:cubic}) one sees that for smaller~$M_H$ also $g_{Aha}$ is smaller, leading to a reduced $A \to ha$ branching ratio  and in turn to a lower rate of resonant production. In contrast, the coupling~$g_{HZa}$ that drives resonant production in the case of the mono-$Z$ signal does not depend on the value of~$M_A$. 

In order for resonant production to be dominant in both the $h + \MET$ and $Z + \MET$ case, we have chosen $\mH = \mA$ in the benchmark scenario~\eqref{eq:benchmark}. The further choice of a common 2HDM Higgs mass $\mH = \mA = \mHc$ is motivated by the observation that such an option minimises the constraints from EW precision observables and vacuum stability. See the discussion in Section~\ref{sec:constraints}. While in our sensitivity studies presented in the next section we will always employ the choice $\mH = \mA = \mHc$, in future \hdma  interpretations of mono-$X$ searches one might however  also want to consider cases with $\mH \neq \mA$. Kinematic distributions and cross-sections as a function of model parameters can be found in Appendix~\ref{app:kinematics}. 

\subsection*{Variation of $\bm{\sin \theta}$}

\begin{figure}[t!]

\caption{\label{fig:svar} $\MET$ ($p_{T,Z}$) distributions for mono-Higgs~(mono-$Z$) production at $13 \, {\rm TeV}$  in the \hdma model. The displayed results correspond to different choices of $\sin \theta$. The remaining parameters are fixed to~\eqref{eq:benchmark} using $\mH = \mA = \mHc = 700 \, {\rm GeV}$ and $\ma = 400 \, {\rm GeV}$. }
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:svar} shows $\MET$ distributions in $h + \MET$ production~(left panel) and $p_{T,Z}$ distributions in $Z+\MET$ production~(right panel) for different~values of $\sin \theta$. The spin-0 masses are chosen as $\mH = \mA = \mHc = 700 \, {\rm GeV}$ and $\ma = 400 \, {\rm GeV}$, and the remaining parameters are fixed to~\eqref{eq:benchmark}. From the two panels it is evident that a variation of $\sin \theta$ leads to both a rate and shape change in the case of the mono-Higgs signal, while in the case of the mono-$Z$ channel only the total cross section gets rescaled to first approximation. The strong sensitivity of the shape of the $\MET$ spectrum in $h + \MET$ production is a again a result of the interplay of resonant and non-resonant contributions. While the $gg \to A \to h a \to h \chi \bar \chi$  amplitude scales as $\sin \theta \cos^3 \theta$, the $gg \to h a  \to h \chi \bar \chi$ matrix element shows a $\sin \theta \cos \theta$ dependence. These scalings imply that at small (large) $\sin \theta$ the resonant~(non-resonant) amplitudes provide the dominant contribution to the $\MET$ distribution in mono-Higgs production. In the case of the mono-$Z$ signal the resonant and non-resonant amplitudes both scale as $\sin \theta \cos \theta$ and in consequence the cross section and all kinematic distributions are essentially not distorted  under changes of the mixing angle~$\theta$. Notice that the latter statement also holds in the case of the $t \bar t +\MET$, $b \bar b + \MET$ and mono-jet signatures.  This can be deduced from~\eqref{eq:rescaling}. 

From the above discussion it follows that the choice $\sin \theta = 0.35$ made in~\eqref{eq:benchmark} leads to an enhanced sensitivity of the mono-Higgs signal to the \hdma parameter space. To perform parameter scans in scenarios with larger mixing angles like $\sin \theta = 0.7$ would however also be worthwhile because such a choice would lead to an improved coverage via the mono-$Z$ channel. We finally note that in scenarios with $\sin \theta >0.35$ the maximal allowed size of mass splitting $M_H - M_a$ is more constrained by vacuum stability arguments than in~\eqref{eq:benchmark}. This is can be seen from~\eqref{eq:BFB2}. 

\subsection*{Variation of $\bm{\tan \beta}$}

The parameters not detailed in the plots are set to~\eqref{eq:benchmark} using $\mH = \mA = \mHc = 700 \, {\rm GeV}$ and $\ma = 200 \, {\rm GeV}$.}
\end{figure}

In Figure~\ref{fig:tbvar1} we display $\MET$ distributions in mono-Higgs production for different choices of $\tan \beta$. The left (right) panel illustrates the contributions from the $gg \to h + \MET$ ($b \bar b \to h + \MET$) channel. The shown results have been obtained at $13 \, {\rm TeV}$ and employ~\eqref{eq:benchmark} with $\mH = \mA = \mHc = 700 \, {\rm GeV}$ and $\ma = 200 \, {\rm GeV}$. One first notices that the total production cross section in $gg$-fusion strongly decreases with increasing $\tan \beta$, while in the case of $b \bar b$-fusion the opposite behaviour is observed. The strong depletion/enhancement of the production rates originates from the fact that in  the type-II~\hdma model considered in this whitepaper the couplings of $H,A,a$ to top quarks are proportional to $\cot \beta$, while the corresponding couplings to bottom quarks are proportional to $\tan \beta$. Numerically, we find that for $\tan \beta \gtrsim 5$ the $gg$-fusion and $b\bar b$-fusion contributions to mono-Higgs production are comparable in size and thus both channels have to included to obtain accurate predictions. From the two panels it is furthermore apparent that variations of $\tan \beta$ do not only change the overall signal strength, but also have a pronounced impact on the shapes of the $\MET$ distributions. In particular, changes in $\tan \beta$ influence the importance of resonant versus non-resonant contributions.

\end{figure}

{\color{red} Similar to the mono-Higgs channel also for the mono-$Z$ signal $b \bar b$-initiated production can be relevant for sufficiently large values of $\tan \beta$~\cite{Bauer:2017ota}. Figure~\ref{fig:tbvar2} displays $p_{T,Z}$ spectra in mono-$Z$ production for different choices of $\tan \beta$ in both the $gg$-fusion~(left panel) and $b \bar b$-fusion~(right panel) channel.  From the plots one sees that for the considered parameters $\mH = \mA = \mHc = 700 \, {\rm GeV}$ and $\ma = 200 \, {\rm GeV}$,  production in $b \bar b$-fusion dominates over $gg$-fusion already for the choice $\tan \beta = 5$. One also observes that  in the mono-$Z$ case   the shapes of the differential distributions are significantly less distorted under changes of $\tan \beta$ than the mono-Higgs spectra. For the sake of completeness, we furthermore  add that the modifications in the kinematic distributions of $t \bar t + \MET$ and $j +\MET$ production under changes of $\tan \beta$ are like in the mono-$Z$ case not very pronounced.} 

Our  scans in the $M_{a}\hspace{0.5mm}$--$\hspace{0.5mm} M_H$ plane are based on the choice $\tan \beta = 1$, since for this value the existing mono-Higgs and mono-$Z$ searches already allow to probe/exclude large regions in the mass planes. In  future ATLAS and CMS analyses it would however be desirable that scans in $\tan \beta$ are carried out as well (cf. Section~\ref{sec:sensitivitystudies} and~\cite{No:2015xqa,Bauer:2017ota,Pani:2017qyd}). We add that in such a scan special attention has to be given to the fact that in the large-$\tan \beta$ limit the total decay widths of some of the Higgs states can become very large, potentially invalidating the NWA.

\end{figure}

The modifications of the $\MET$~($p_{T,Z}$) spectrum in $h+\MET$~($Z+\MET$) production under a variation of the DM mass $m_\chi$ are illustrated in the two panels of Figure~\ref{fig:mdmvar}. The given predictions correspond to $pp$ collision at $13 \, {\rm TeV}$ and employ the benchmark parameters~\eqref{eq:benchmark} with $\mH = \mA = \mHc = 700 \, {\rm GeV}$ and $\ma = 300 \, {\rm GeV}$. One observes that the depicted scenarios with $\ma  > 2 m_\chi$ (green and purple histograms) lead to almost identical rates, $\MET$ and $p_{T,Z}$ spectra, while the choice $\ma  < 2 m_\chi$ (blue histograms) 
largely reduces the total rates and also modifies the shapes of the shown distributions. This feature is expected since for $\ma > m_\chi/2$ ($\ma < m_\chi/2$) the decay channel $a \to \chi \bar \chi$ is kinematically allowed~(forbidden). In order to have detectable mono-$X$ signals even for light mediators~$a$, we have chosen a value of  $m_\chi = 10 \, {\rm GeV}$ as the baseline for the following sensitivity studies. {\color{red} [Caterina: suggest a forward reference to the relic density]}

\section{Non-$\bm{E_T^{\rm miss}}$ collider signatures}
\label{sec:nonMET}

In this section we will discuss the most important non-$\MET$ signals that can be used to explore the parameter space of the \hdma model at the LHC. Most of the discussion will be centred around final states containing top quarks since these channels provide the best sensitivity to model realisations with low $\tan \beta$ such as our benchmark parameter choice~\eqref{eq:benchmark}. Final states that give excess to the \hdma parameter space with large $\tan \beta$ such as di-tau searches will however also be discussed briefly. 

\subsection{Di-top  searches}
\label{sec:ttbarresonances}

In all 2HDM models, the spin-0 bosons $H,A$  decay dominantly to top-quark pairs if these states have masses above the top-quark threshold,~i.e.~$M_{H, A} > 2 m_t$, and if $\tan \beta = {\cal O}(1)$. New-physics scenarios of this kind can thus be tested by studying the $t \bar t$ invariant mass spectrum $m_{t \bar t}$.  Interference effects between the signal process and the SM  $t \bar t$ background however distort the $m_{t \bar t}$ signal shape from a single peak to a peak-dip structure~\cite{Gaemers:1984sj,Dicus:1994bm,Bernreuther:1997gs,Frederix:2007gi,Hespel:2016qaf}, a feature that represents a serious obstacle to probe 2HDM models with $M_{H,A} > 350 \, {\rm GeV}$ and small $\tan \beta$ values~\cite{Craig:2015jba,Hajer:2015gka,Gori:2016zto,Carena:2016npr}.

The shown results employ $\mH=\mA=\mHc = 600 \, {\rm GeV}$,  $\ma=100 \, {\rm GeV}$, $\tan \beta =0.4$ and $\sin \theta = 0$, and correspond to $20.3 \, {\rm fb}^{-1}$ of 8 TeV data.  The parameters not explicitly specified are chosen as in~\eqref{eq:benchmark}. {\color{red} [Uli: Fix notation etc.!]}}
\label{fig:ttres_2HDMvs2HDMa}
\end{figure}

The first LHC analysis that takes into account interference effects between the signal process $gg \to H/A \to t \bar t$ and the SM background $gg \to t \bar t$ is the ATLAS search~\cite{Aaboud:2017hnm}. This search  is based on an integrated luminosity of $20.3 \, {\rm fb}^{-1}$ collected at $8 \, {\rm TeV}$. The results are interpreted in alignment limit of the usual type-II 2HDM. The obtained  exclusion limits in the $M_{H,A}\hspace{0.5mm}$--$\hspace{0.5mm} \tan \beta$ plane turn out to be significantly stronger than previously published LHC constraints on the 2HDM parameter space with low $\tan \beta$ and $M_{H,A} \in [500, 650] \, {\rm GeV}$. For instance,  for $M_{H,A} = 500 \, {\rm GeV}$ values of $\tan \beta < 1$ are disfavoured at 95\%~CL. A~similar parameter space  can be probed if the results~\cite{Aaboud:2017hnm} are reinterpreted in the context of the \hdma model~\cite{Bauer:2017ota}. 

An assortment of di-top invariant mass spectra corresponding to the \hdma model are shown in Figures~\ref{fig:ttres_2HDMvs2HDMa} and \ref{fig:ttres_2HDM_A}. The signal process has been obtained by treating the loop contributions from top and bottom quarks as form factors a la~\cite{FranzosiZhang}. In this way the interference between the signal and the tree-level SM background from $gg \to t \bar t$ can be calculated at leading order in QCD. In Figure~\ref{fig:ttres_2HDMvs2HDMa}, we show predictions for the $m_{t \bar t}$ spectra in $gg \to H \to t \bar t$~(left panel) and $gg \to H \to t \bar t$~(right panel). The black histograms illustrates the 2HDM predictions~\cite{Aaboud:2017hnm}, while the red curves represent the corresponding \hdma predictions for the choice $\sin \theta = 0$, which effectively decouples the mediator $a$ from the 2HDM Higgs sector. The agreement between the black and red predictions serves as a validation of our form factor implementation in the \hdma model. 

As examples of the parameter dependences of the $t \bar t$ predictions in the \hdma model, we display in  Figure~\ref{fig:ttres_2HDM_A} several $m_{t \bar t}$ spectra in $pp \to A \to t \bar t$ either fixing $\sin \theta$ and varying $\tan \beta$ (left panel) or vice versa (right panel). The Higgs masses are chosen $\mH=\mA=\mHc =600 \, {\rm GeV}$ and $\ma=100 \, {\rm GeV}$, which implies that only the  decays $H/A \to t \bar t$  are kinematically possible but not $a \to t \bar t$.  From the left panel one sees that increasing $\tan \beta$ leads  to a reduction of the signal strength.  Likewise, larger values of $\sin \theta$ also lead to lower $t \bar t$ cross sections as illustrated on the right-hand side of the latter figure. These are expected features because the $g g \to A$ amplitude  scales as $\cot \beta \cos \theta$.  One also observes that the interference between the $t \bar t$ signal and the corresponding background, and thus the shape of the $m_{t \bar t}$ spectrum, depends on the precise choice of $\tan \beta$  and $\sin \theta$.  Before moving on, let us add that the results of~\cite{Aaboud:2017hnm} have already been recasted to the \hdma model in~\cite{Bauer:2017ota}. For the parameter benchmarks studied in the latter paper it turns out that $\tan \beta < {\cal O} ( 0.5)$ values can be probed/excluded based on the 8 TeV ATLAS search, rendering the resulting $t \bar t$ constraints weaker than those arising at present from flavour physics~(see Section~\ref{sec:constraints}).

\label{fig:ttres_2HDM_A}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Four-top searches}

The four-top final state is a rare, yet increasingly important signature, since it  will gain sensitivity and thus attention with the~LHC collecting more and more luminosity (see for instance~\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2016-104,Sirunyan:2017roi,Aaboud:2018xuw,Hajer:2015gka,Gori:2016zto,Alvarez:2016nrz}).  In fact, in the work~\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2016-104} the results of a search for the four-top final state based on $13.2 \, {\rm fb}^{-1}$ of 13 TeV LHC data has already been interpreted in the context of the normal 2HDM. The comparison to the predictions for a type-II 2HDM in the alignment limit allows the exclusion at the 95\%~CL of $\tan \beta$  below 0.17 (0.11) for $\mH = 400 \, {\rm GeV}$ ($\mH = 1 \, {\rm TeV}$). While these limits are weaker than those that can be obtained from $t \bar t$ production in the $M_{H} \in [500, 650] \, {\rm GeV}$ range~\cite{Aaboud:2017hnm}, in the long run, four-top searches can be expected to have a better sensitivity than $t \bar t$ searches for mediators with masses close to the top threshold and very heavy Higgses.

Parameters not explicitly specified are set to~\eqref{eq:benchmark}.  The SM and the different new-physics contributions are indicated by the black and coloured lines. See text for further explanations. {\color{red} [Uli: Fix notation, colours,  etc.! I would also suggest to remove the DMSimp curve in the right plot.]}}
\end{figure}

In this whitepaper we perform a first characterisation of the four-top signature in the \hdma context by studied the predicted cross section for different parameter choices. Predictions for the four-top cross section ($\sigma_{4t}$) as a function of $\tan \beta$~(left panel) and $\ma$~(right panel) are presented in~Figure~\ref{fig:4top}. The total four-top production cross section in the SM ($|{\rm SM}|^2$) is indicated by a black dashed-dotted line in both panels, while the new-physics~(NP) contributions ($|{\rm NP}|^2$) are represented by the blue curves. The predictions that account for both the SM and the \hdma contribution as well as  their interference ($|{\rm SM} + {\rm NP}|^2$) are coloured red. The contributions from associated $t \bar t$ production of an on-shell $H, A, a$ with the subsequent decay $H/A/a \to t \bar t$ are also given. From the left panel one can see that for the chosen parameters on-shell production of $H$ and $A$ provides the dominant contribution to inclusive cross section. Interference effects turn out to be small as they modify the results  by only ${\cal O} (5\%)$ at the inclusive level. This feature is illustrated in the lower part of the left plot.

On the right-hand side in Figure~\ref{fig:4top} we instead  study the $\ma$ dependence of the cross section. One first observes that for the chosen parameters the $|{\rm NP}|^2$ contribution is rather flat in $\ma$. The breakdown of the on-shell contributions furthermore shows that for $\ma \lesssim 800 \, {\rm GeV}$ the contribution from $t \bar t + a$ production dominates, while for $\ma \gtrsim 800 \, {\rm GeV}$ the $t \bar t + H/A$ channels are numerically more important. The little bump at $1 \, {\rm TeV}$ is due to interference effects between the three Higgs states.  As for the previous benchmark,  the impact of the signal-background interference on the inclusive cross section is found to be small (i.e.~below 2\%), except for $\ma$ values close to the top threshold.

\end{figure}

In Figure~\ref{DMHF-4top-scan3} we finally plot the  $\sin \theta$ dependence of the new-physics contribution~$|{\rm NP}|^2$ to the cross section of four-top production for the two benchmarks studied before. 
One sees that in the case of $\mH =\mA=\mHc = 1 \, {\rm TeV}$ and $\ma = \, ? \, \, {\rm GeV}$ (black curve) the cross section  increases for increasing $\sin \theta$. This is expected because the dominant contribution to the signal arises from $t \bar t + a$ production followed by $a \to t \bar t$ and the coupling of the $a$ to top quarks scales as $\sin \theta$. In the case of $\mH =\mA=\mHc = 600 \, {\rm GeV}$ and $\ma = 400 \, {\rm GeV}$~(magenta curve) the cross section instead decreases with increasing $\sin \theta$. This feature is due to the fact that the $H/A \to t \bar t$ amplitudes scale as $\cos \theta$ and that in addition the $a\rightarrow \ttbar$ decay is closed for the chosen parameters. {\color{red} [Uli: Clarify the choice of $\ma$!]}

\subsection{Other final states}
\label{sec:others}

The $\tau^+ \tau^-$ final state is one of the most common channels that experiments have considered to search for additional neutral Higgs bosons (see~\cite{Aaboud:2017sjh,Sirunyan:2018zut} for the latest LHC results). The sensitivity of the $\tau^+ \tau^-$ to the \hdma parameter space has been studied in the article~\cite{Bauer:2017ota}. There it was found that future $\tau^+ \tau^-$ searches may be able to probe models with $\tan \beta  = {\cal O} (1)$ and Higgs masses around $300 \, {\rm GeV}$. Since such realisations are not easy to test otherwise, interpreting the results of forthcoming  $\tau^+ \tau^-$ searches in the \hdma context seems to be worthwhile.  

If $\mH > \ma + M_Z$ and the mediator $a$ is sufficiently heavy,~i.e.~$\ma > 2 m_t$, another channel that offers sensitivity to the  $\hdma$ parameter space is $pp \to aZ$ with $a \to t \bar t$ instead of $a \to \chi \bar \chi$~\cite{GPHeidelberg}. The corresponding $t \bar t Z$ final state has been recently studied~\cite{Haisch:2018djm} in the context of the normal 2HDM and shown to lead to a robust coverage of the 2HDM parameter space with $M_{H,A} > 350 \, {\rm GeV}$, $|M_H - M_A| > M_Z$ and $\tan \beta = {\cal O} (1)$ at future LHC runs. The analysis strategy detailed in~\cite{Haisch:2018djm} can be directly applied to the \hdma case, and should allow to probe model realisations that feature $a$ mediators with masses above the top threshold which are difficult to explore via a mono-$Z$ search (see Section~\ref{sec:sensi_monozll}).

The ATLAS and CMS collaborations have set limits on the production of charged Higgses in both the $\tau \nu$~\cite{Aaboud:2016dig,CMS-PAS-HIG-16-031} and the $tb$~\cite{Aad:2015typ,Khachatryan:2015qxa,ATLAS:2016qiq} final state. The limits given in~\cite{ATLAS:2016qiq} have been used in~\cite{Pani:2017qyd} to derive constraints on the \hdma model. It turns out that  the constraints on the \hdma parameter space are generically weaker than those obtained in the 2HDM context, because in the \hdma model  the $H^\pm \to tb$ branching tends to be reduced compared to the 2HDM since the partial decay width $H^\pm \to aW^\pm$ is generically non-vanishing.  However, compared to the $tW+\MET$ signature, $tb$ searches can still provide complementary information, because the non-$\MET$  search can test $\mHc$ values below around $350 \, {\rm GeV}$ which are not easily accessible with the corresponding $\MET$ signature~\cite{Pani:2017qyd}. Another signal that can be used to search for charged Higgses is the $tbW$ final state~\cite{Haisch:2018djm}. This channel has however not yet been explored in the \hdma context. 

\section{Sensitivity studies}
\label{sec:sensitivitystudies}

In this section we present sensitivity estimates for two of the main $\MET$ signatures in the \hdma model, namely the $h +\MET$  and the $Z+\MET$ channels. Specifically, we will consider the mono-Higgs (mono-$Z$) signal in the $b \bar b$ ($\ell^+ \ell^-$) channel. Our studies are based on generator-level reinterpretation of existing results with  $36 \, {\rm fb}^{-1}$ of LHC data taken at $\sqrt{s} = 13 \, {\rm TeV}$. These results contain different amounts of public information. In the mono-Higgs case model-independent limits presented in~\cite{Aaboud:2017yqz} are used for the reinterpretation, while in the mono-$Z$ case  the sensitivity is estimated using generator-level information on the signal together with published background estimates~\cite{Aaboud:2017bja}. The sensitivities that other~$\MET$ searches provide are also briefly discussed below.

\label{fig:monoHbb_sensi}
\end{figure}

The sensitivity estimates of the ATLAS and CMS mono-Higgs searches in the $b \bar b$ channel to the \hdma model are based on the model-independent limits on the anomalous production of the SM Higgs boson in association with \met derived in~\cite{Aaboud:2017yqz}.  As these limits are set in terms of the observed production cross section of non-SM events with large $\MET$ and a Higgs boson, they can be compared directly to the cross sections obtained in the \hdma model after taking into account the kinematic acceptance $\mathcal{A}$ of the event selection and the detection efficiency $\varepsilon$. The variables of interest for the sensitivity study of the $b \bar b + \MET$ searches are 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:monoHbb_sensi}
S_i = \frac{\sigma_{i} \left ( p p \to h + \MET \right)_{\hdma} \cdot {\rm BR} \left (h \to b \bar b \right )_{\rm SM} \cdot \left ( \mathcal{A} \cdot \varepsilon \right)_i}
{\sigma_{i} \left ( p p \to h + \MET \to b \bar b + \MET \right)_{\rm obs}}\,,
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_{i} \left ( p p \to h + \MET \right)_{\hdma}$ is the partonic cross section of the \hdma signal,  the branching ratio of the SM Higgs boson is denoted by ${\rm BR} \left (h \to b \bar b \right )_{\rm SM} \simeq 58\%$  and $\sigma_{i} \left ( p p \to h + \MET \to b \bar b + \MET \right)_{\rm obs}$ represents the  observed upper cross-section limit on $h + \MET$ production with $h \to b \bar b$. The cross sections as well as the product $ \mathcal{A} \cdot \varepsilon$ depend on the considered $\MET$ bin as indicated by the index $i$.  A particular point in parameter space is excluded if the sum $S = \sum_i S_i$ of the individual sensitivities is larger than $1$. 

The results of the sensitivity study for the mono-Higgs signal in the $b \bar b$ decay channel are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:monoHbb_sensi}. The upper panel in the figure displays $S$  as a function of $\ma$ and $\mA$. The observed cross-section limits $\sigma_{i} \left ( p p \to h + \MET \to b \bar b + \MET \right)_{\rm obs}$ as well as the products $({\cal A} \cdot  \varepsilon)_i$ that enter~\eqref{eq:monoHbb_sensi}  are  taken from the recent ATLAS study~\cite{Aaboud:2017yqz}. One observes that the existing mono-Higgs searches allow to probe/exclude \hdma scenarios with  $\mA > M_h + \ma$  and sufficiently small $\ma$ values, while they are only weakly  sensitive to models where the mass hierarchy between $A$ and $a$ is reversed,~i.e.~$\ma > M_h + \mA$. Numerically, we find that  for  a light $a$ with $\ma \simeq 100 \, {\rm GeV}$ one has $S > 1$ for all values $\mA \simeq [350, 1050] \, {\rm GeV}$. Notice that in the parameter region  $\mA > M_h + \ma$ the strong sensitivity of the search arises because the mono-Higgs signature is resonantly produced via $pp \to A \to ha \to h \chi \bar \chi$ --- see the discussion in Section~\ref{sec:resonant}. The sensitivity of the search decreases for increasing (decreasing) $M_A$ because the production rate of $pp \to A$  decreases $\big($the Jacobian peak~\eqref{eq:monoHMETpeak} is shifted to lower $\MET$ values$\big)$. In the region $\ma > M_h + \mA$, the largest contribution to the $h + \MET$ cross section again originates from resonant production, namely $pp \to a \to hA \to h \chi \bar \chi$. The resulting sensitivities are however compared to the case discussed before much smaller because  $\sigma \left (p p \to a \right )/\sigma \left (pp \to A \right ) = \sin^2 \theta/\cos^2 \theta \simeq 1/7$, ${\rm BR} \left ( a \to A h \right )/{\rm BR} \left (  A \to a h  \right ) < 1$ and ${\rm BR} \left ( A \to \chi \bar \chi \right )/{\rm BR} \left (  a \to \chi \bar \chi \right ) \ll 1$ for the parameter choices made in \eqref{eq:benchmark}.

{\color{red} The lower panel in Figure~\ref{fig:monoHbb_sensi} shows the sensitivity $S$ in the $\ma\hspace{0.25mm}$--$\hspace{0.25mm}\tan \beta$ plane fixing  $\mH, \mA$ and  $\mHc$ to~\eqref{eq:matbscan}.} One observes that the existing mono-Higgs searches allow to exclude $\tan \beta \lesssim 3$ for $m_a \simeq 100 \, {\rm GeV}$ and $\tan \beta \lesssim 1$ for $m_a \lesssim 225 \, {\rm GeV}$. From~Figure~\ref{fig:tbvar} it is apparent that for such small values of $\tan \beta$, the $h + \MET$ signal is dominantly produced through top-quark loops in $gg$-fusion. The corresponding production rate scales as $\sigma \left ( gg \to A \right ) \propto \cot^2 \beta$, and as a result the sensitivity rapidly decreases for $\tan \beta > 1$. Notice that the decrease is to some extent counteracted by the fact that the Jacobian peak becomes more pronounced when  $\tan \beta$ is increased (cf.~the left panel in Figure~\ref{fig:tbvar}). Another feature that is visible in the  lower panel in Figure~\ref{fig:monoHbb_sensi}  is that at $\tan \beta \gtrsim 10$ the sensitivity of the mono-Higgs search  starts to increase again, because the $b \bar b$-initiated production cross section behaves like $\sigma \hspace{0.5mm} ( b \bar b \to A  ) \propto \tan^2 \beta$. Further plots of our mono-Higgs sensitivity study can be found in Appendix~\ref{app:extramonoh}.

\subsection[Mono-$Z$ study]{Mono-$\bm{Z}$ study}
\label{sec:sensi_monozll}

In the absence of model-independent limits on anomalous production of $Z + \MET$ events, the expected sensitivity of the mono-$Z$ search to the \hdma model is estimated by comparing the number of generator-level signal events to the number of expected background events. The published background predictions for $Z+\MET$ production followed by $Z \to \ell^+ \ell^-$~\cite{Aaboud:2017bja} are used which correspond to $36 \, {\rm fb}^{-1}$ of $13 \, {\rm TeV}$ data. The selection cuts and \MET binnings that are applied to the signal events resemble those employed in the ATLAS analysis~\cite{Aaboud:2017bja}. A reconstruction efficiency of 75\% is assumed for signal events,  and a conservative background systematic uncertainty of 20\% (10\%) is taken for events with $\MET < 120  \, {\rm GeV}$ ($\MET > 120  \, {\rm GeV}$). Following the Asimov approximation, the significance $Z_{A,i}$ for individual bins $i$ is calculated as a Poisson ratio of likelihoods modified to incorporate systematic uncertainties on the background. Explicitly one has \cite{Cowan:2012}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:significance_wsyst}
Z_{A, i} = \sqrt{ 2 \left ( \left ( s + b \right ) \ln \left [ \frac{\left (s+b \right ) \left (b + \sigma_b^2 \right )}{b^2 + \left ( s +b \right ) \sigma_b^2 } \right ]  - \frac{b^2}{\sigma_b^2} \ln \left [ 1 + \frac{\sigma_b^2 s}{b \left ( b + \sigma_b^2 \right )} \right ] \right ) } \,, 
\end{equation}
where $s$ ($b$) represents the expected number of signal (background) events and $\sigma_s$ ($ \sigma_b$) denotes the corresponding standard deviation that characterises systematic uncertainties. The total significance $Z_A$ is then defined by adding the individual $Z_{A, i}$ in quadrature. The ATLAS and CMS experiments are expected to be sensitive to regions with total significances of~$Z_A > 2$. %{\color{red} [Uli: Why $Z_A > 2$? Since $Z_A = \Phi^{-1} (1 - p)$ with $\Phi^{-1}$ the quantile of the standard Gaussian distribution, a 95\% CL corresponds to $Z_A = 1.64$. $Z_A = 2$ corresponds to around 98\% CL. What is the connection to the CLs method?]}
 
The results of our sensitivity study for the mono-$Z$ signature in the $\ell^+ \ell^-$ channel are presented in Figure~\ref{fig:monoZll_sensi}. The upper (lower) panel displays the total significance $Z_A$  in the $\ma\hspace{0.25mm}$--$\hspace{0.25mm}\mA$ ($\ma\hspace{0.25mm}$--$\hspace{0.25mm}\tan \beta$) plane. Comparing the obtained results to those depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:monoHbb_sensi}, one observes that for the parameter choices~\eqref{eq:benchmark} the mono-$Z$ and mono-Higgs searches allow to test quite similar parameter regions in the $\ma\hspace{0.25mm}$--$\hspace{0.25mm}\mA$ plane. Numerically, we find  that for $\ma \simeq 100 \, {\rm GeV}$  the existing $Z + \MET$ searches are sensitive to 2HDM pseudoscalar masses  in the range of $\mA \simeq [300, 1050] \, {\rm GeV}$. Notice that the mono-$Z$ sensitivity to lower values of $M_A$ is slightly better than the one found in the mono-Higgs case. This enhanced sensitivity arises because for fixed $M_A$ and $M_a$ and given that $M_Z < M_h$ the endpoint $E_{T, \rm max}^{\rm miss}$ of the $\MET$ distribution in $Z+ \MET$ production is always higher  than that in  the $h+ \MET$ channel. In contrast, in the parameter region with $M_a > M_Z + M_A$ the sensitivity of the mono-$Z$ signature is weaker than that of the mono-Higgs  signal. This feature is readily understood by noticing that the $pp \to a \to Z H$ channel does not lead to a $\MET$ signature, since the scalar $H$ does not decay invisibly in the \hdma model. For $M_a > M_Z + M_A$ hence only non-resonant diagrams contribute to the $Z+\MET$ signature, and the sensitivity to such model realisations is consequently very weak. 

{\color{red} In the lower panel of Figure~\ref{fig:monoZll_sensi} we plot the significance $Z_A$ in the $\ma\hspace{0.25mm}$--$\hspace{0.25mm}\tan \beta$ plane for the choice~\eqref{eq:matbscan}. } {\color{red} [Uli: Correct? Or other choice?]} We see that present mono-$Z$ searches are able to exclude $\tan \beta \lesssim 3.5$ for $m_a \simeq 100 \, {\rm GeV}$ and $\tan \beta \lesssim 1$ for $m_a \lesssim 325 \, {\rm GeV}$. The quoted exclusion limits compare favourable with the mono-Higgs case. We add that in models where the bottom-quark Yukawa coupling is $\tan \beta$ enhanced such as the type-II scenario studied here, $b \bar b \to Z + \MET$ production starts to become relevant for  $\tan \beta \gtrsim 10$~\cite{Bauer:2017ota}. Since only $gg$-fusion but not $b \bar b$-fusion production is included in our mono-$Z$ simulations, only $\tan \beta$ values up to 5.5 are plotted in the lower panel of Figure~\ref{fig:monoZll_sensi}. Further details on our mono-$Z$ sensitivity study are given in Appendix~\ref{app:extramonoz}.

\subsection[Sensitivity of other mono-$X$ channels]{Sensitivity of other mono-$\bm{X}$ channels}
\label{sec:sensi_others}

The sensitivities of the LHC to the associated production of DM with a single top has been  studied in the framework of the \hdma model in~\cite{Pani:2017qyd}. This analysis assumes $300 \, {\rm fb}^{-1}$ of data and finds that the $t X + \MET$ signatures complement the parameter space coverage of the mono-Higgs and  mono-$Z$ signals considered by us in detail.  Since searches for associated production of DM with a single top have so far not been performed at the LHC, one cannot use existing model-independent limits to estimate the sensitivity of these channels. For this reason we do not perform a sensitivity study of the $t X + \MET$ signatures in this whitepaper. 

Sensitivity studies of the $t \bar t + \MET$ and $j + \MET$ channels in the \hdma have been performed in~\cite{Bauer:2017ota}. The results presented in that work imply that for the benchmark parameter choices~\eqref{eq:benchmark}, the latest  $t \bar t + \MET$ and  mono-jet searches that are based on $36 \, {\rm fb}^{-1}$ of 13 TeV data have  only a very weak sensitivity to the parameter space shown in Figures~\ref{fig:monoHbb_sensi} and \ref{fig:monoZll_sensi}. Given the weak sensitivity of the $t \bar t + \MET$ and $j + \MET$ modes we do not perform sensitivity studies for these channels in this whitepaper. The $b \bar b + \MET$ channel is also not considered here due to the same reason. Notice however that a reinterpretion of existing $t \bar t + \MET$, $b \bar b + \MET$ and $j + \MET$ results is straightforward by using the general rescaling strategy discussed in Appendix~\ref{app:recast}.
